Streamline is a real-time chat application inspired by Discord, designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration among users. This README provides an overview of the app and a brief introduction of how I designed the architecture.

Please follow these steps to test the chat app's functionality:

1. Login with two different accounts using two separate browsers or one in a regular tab and the other in an Incognito window.

2. Once logged in, both accounts can send messages and images to each other or initiate a video meeting to communicate face-to-face.

## Features

### Message

- **Real-time Messaging:** Instantly send and receive messages in real-time, creating a dynamic chatting experience.

- **Image Sharing:** Share pictures with ease, allowing users to exchange images.

- **Private Messaging:** Engage in private conversations with other users in a one-on-one setting.

- **Notifications:** Get notified of new messages to stay updated on the conversation.

#### Highlight

- Decoupled WebSocket/WebRTC server from API server for scalable architecture with user growth.
- Utilized Redis caching for instant user online status updates and Pub/Sub for cross-server communication.
- Improved deployment efficiency by containerizing development environments with docker compose.

### Video Meeting Network

#### Advantages

- **Lower CPU Consumption:** Unlike MCUs that process media streams, SFUs primarily focus on routing. As a result, they consume considerably less CPU, making them more cost-effective and scalable, especially in scenarios with a large number of participants.
